These are the view needed for the Orders Dashboard.
To get these views I needed to join the Items and Address tables to the Orders table.

SELECT
	o.order_id,
	i.item_price,
	o.quantity,
	i.item_cat,
	i.item_name,
	o.created_at,
	a.delivery_address1,
	a.delivery_address2,
	a.delivery_city,
	a.delivery_zipcode,
	o.delivery 
FROM
	orders o
	LEFT JOIN item i ON o.item_id = i.item_id
	LEFT JOIN address a ON o.add_id = a.add_id
