Total Staff Cost
Total Hours Worked
List of workers on a given date wi/ shift and comp. data

These are the views I needed for the Staff Dashboard.
I joined the staff and shift tables to the rota table.
The only way I could use the end and start times to calculate staff_cost and hours_in_shift was by calculating the difference in minutes, multiplying it with the rate, and dividing back by 60 to correct the conversions.

SELECT
	r.DATE,
	s.first_name,
	s.last_name,
	s.hourly_rate,
	sh.start_time,
	sh.end_time,
	(
	s.hourly_rate * TIMESTAMPDIFF( MINUTE, sh.start_time, sh.end_time ))/ 60 AS staff_cost,
	(
	TIMESTAMPDIFF( MINUTE, sh.start_time, sh.end_time ))/ 60 AS hours_in_shift 
FROM
	rota r
	LEFT JOIN staff s ON r.staff_id = s.staff_id
	LEFT JOIN shift sh ON r.shift_id = sh.shift_id
